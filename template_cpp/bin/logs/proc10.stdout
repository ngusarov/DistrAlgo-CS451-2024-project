Source files that end in .c will be compiled automatically with gcc,
while source files that end in .cpp will be compiled automatically with g++.
For those that prefer C, they can either use the provided C++
argument parser and write everything else in C, or delete the
provided main.cpp and start from scratch.
Those who have both .c and .cpp files should ensure to have a compatible ABI when calling C functions from C++ (see `hello.h` on how to do this).
